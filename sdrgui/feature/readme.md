![Feature window](../../doc/img/FeatureWindow.png)

<h2>Top bar</h2>

<h3>1: Feature index</h3>

The tooltip displays the feature type name.

You may click on this area and drag the window with the mouse.

<h3>2: Common feature settings</h3>

Opens a dialog to update the common feature settings

![Feature window](../../doc/img/Features_basic_dialog.png)

<h4>2.1: Window title</h4>

Changes the feature window title

<h4>2.2: Reset title to default</h4>

Resets the title to the feature type name.

<h4>2.3: Toggle reverse API feature</h4>

Use this checkbox to toggle on/off the reverse API feature. With reverse API engaged the changes in the feature settings are forwarded to an API endpoint given by address (8.2.4), port (8.2.5), feature set index (8.2.6) and feature index (8.2.7) in the same format as the SDRangel REST API feature settings endpoint. With the values of the screenshot the API URL is: `http://127.0.0.1:8888/sdrangel/featureset/0/feature/0/settings` The JSON payload follows the same format as the SDRangel REST API feature settings. Using the same example this would be:

```
{
  "SimplePTTSettings": {
    "reverseAPIAddress": "127.0.0.1",
    "reverseAPIChannelIndex": 0,
    "reverseAPIDeviceIndex": 0,
    "reverseAPIPort": 8888,
    "rgbColor": -65536,
    "rx2TxDelayMs": 200,
    "rxDeviceSetIndex": 0,
    "title": "Simple PTT",
    "tx2RxDelayMs": 200,
    "txDeviceSetIndex": 1,
    "useReverseAPI": 0
  },
  "featureType": "SimplePTT"
}
```
Note that the PATCH method is used. The full set of parameters is sent with the PUT method only when the reverse API is toggled on or a full settings update is done.
